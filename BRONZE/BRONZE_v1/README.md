# BRONZE CHALLENGE v1

These files integrates:
    - Wifi 
    - GUI
    - Infrared
    - Ultrasonic 
    - Right turns
    - Left turns 
    - Reverse
    - Straight
    - Obstacle stopping 

## Possible improvements to v1:
    - Currently when car is stopped by ultrasonic sensor, the interrupts can still trigger and make the car go right/left.
    - GUI's slider bars to calibrate the right and left turns, still not very good. Most data is lost. Not really usable.
        - Have buttons instead? With calibration values at different intervals? 
        - Still need to include a slider/dial to control the velocity for straights. 
    
#### Overall, the car is good to go for the challenge, with calibrations still necessary. Will work on the issues above over the weekend.
